# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
> BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, has experienced a decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for the post-lockdown period and boost their revenue, they have contracted a consulting company to determine the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The company aims to identify significant variables that can predict bike demand and assess how well these variables describe the demand. They have collected a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demands, incorporating factors such as meteorological surveys and people's preferences. By analyzing these variables, BoomBikes intends to gain insights that will allow them to stand out from other service providers, cater to people's needs effectively, and maximize their profits once the situation improves.
